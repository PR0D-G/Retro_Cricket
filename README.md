Phase 1 – Core Gameplay (Easy & Most Important)

[✔] Fit screen background (basic UI scaling)
[✔] Button alignment (ensure responsive & usable UI)
[✔] batsman & bowler
[✔] Scoreboard to show scores (must-have for gameplay clarity)
[✔] Target and Defend
[✔] No. of wickets (basic gameplay mechanic)
[✔]Pop-up for winner background image for win and lose  (game loop closure)
[ ] Toss for batting or bowling (odd/even choice) (game start logic)
[ ] Retro audio (basic effects like bat hit, crowd noise, game over sound)

Phase 2 – Immersion & Retro Feel (Medium Difficulty)

[✔] Loading screen (retro-style “loading…” adds polish)
[✔]Better home screen (menus, retro design, maybe pixel art)
[ ] Moving audience (gif/looped sprite animation like old games)
[ ] Moving batsman & bowler (simple looping animation)
[ ] 1 in 20 chance: Audience shout + decibel meter animation for  (rare excitement effect)

Phase 3 – Advanced Gameplay Modes

[ ] Super Over (special rule after tie)
[ ] Easter eggs (like rare events – rain break, dog in stadium, UFO sighting, etc.)

Phase 4 – Community & Progression (Harder)

[ ] Optional login/auth (player persistence)
[ ] High score & streak manager (track records across sessions)
[ ] Creating avatar (basic pixel customizations)

Phase 5 – Online & Fun Additions (Hardest / Future)

[ ] Online multiplayer (big step: networking, sync)
[ ] Create rooms (lobby system)
[ ] Special celebrations / references
[ ] Winning shot = Six → Dhoni reference
[ ] 264 → Rohit Sharma reference
[ ] 6 sixes in a row → Yuvraj Singh celebration

Now you can mark done like this: [x].
Do you want me to also make a compact single-line checklist version (like a to-do list style) so it looks cleaner in Notepad?
